# Set assembly and app versions in TFS team build
## Introduction
One of the most common customizations in TFS XAML build templates was to automatically update the 
assembly version number. This can also be done in build vNext using a small power shell script.

I also added the option to apply the version to SharePoint / Office 365 apps. 

## Description
Please see [my post on writeabout.net]("http://writeabout.net/2015/11/01/set-assembly-and-app-version-to-a-matching-build-name-in-tfs-2015-or-vso-build-vnext/") for more 
details how to use the script in you build.
